== Literary significance and criticism ==
A novel which is the work of a man of genius. It will attract the highest class of readers. —Times.
There are many beautiful passages and descriptions in this book. The characters are extremely well drawn. ——Athenæum.
A clever novel. The incidents are exciting, and the interest is maintained to the close. It may be doubted if Sir Walter Scott himself ever painted a Scotch fireside with more truth. —Morning Post.
David Elginbrod is the finest character we have met in fiction for many a day. The descriptions of natural scenery are vivid, truthful, and artistic; the general reflections are those of a refined, thoughtful, and poetical philosopher, and the whole moral atmosphere of the book la lofty, pure, and invigorating. —Globe.
