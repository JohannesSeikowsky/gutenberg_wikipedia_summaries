The Good Hope (from Dutch: Op hoop van zegen; more literally: Hoping for the best) is a Dutch play written by Herman Heijermans in 1900/1901.
It takes place in a fishing village, with the conflict between the fishermen and their employer ending in tragedy with the unsound boat setting out to sea and sinking with all hands and the owner pocketing the insurance money. 
The play is still staged today, and remains the most popular play by Dutch dramatist Herman Heijermans. A socialist, Heijermans is considered to have meant the play as a criticism of the entire capitalist system, though some present-day productions downplay this radical approach.
The plat was translated in a new version for the Royal National Theatre, which relocated the action to the Yorkshire fishing community of Whitby in 1900, by Lee Hall.


== Plot ==
The voyage of The Good Hope is a journey on which the life of the entire community depends. A storm rages, the women and children wait ashore, the boat follows the Greenland catch. A Dutch classic of the social realist theatre.


== Background ==
