Lux Mundi: A Series of Studies in the Religion of the Incarnation is a collection of 12 essays by liberal Anglo-Catholic theologians published in 1889. It was edited by Charles Gore, then the principal of Pusey House, Oxford, and a future Bishop of Oxford.
Gore's essay, "The Holy Spirit and Inspiration", which showed an ability to accept discoveries of contemporary science, marked a break from the conservative Anglo-Catholic thought of figures such as Edward Bouverie Pusey. He subsequently remedied Christological deficiency in his 1891 Bampton Lectures, The Incarnation of the Son of God.
Gore and Lux Mundi came to influence the 20th-century Archbishop of Canterbury William Temple.
