As Other Men Are is a 1925 collection of short stories by the English author Dornford Yates (Cecil William Mercer), first published in The Windsor Magazine. The title is a reference to the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican. 


== Plot ==
The book consists of ten short stories, many of which revolve around the relations between an impecunious former officer of the Great War and a woman of wealth. The title of each is the name of a significant male character.


== Background ==
The stories were written for The Windsor Magazine.


== Chapters ==


== Critical reception ==
The author’s biographer AJ Smithers noted that these tales have a rather harsher tone than that of the earlier stories. Although they all have a happy ending, as required by the editor of The Windsor Magazine, he felt that by this date the writer was no longer seeing romance in the old-fashioned way. Some of his women can be greedy and vinegar-tongued, particularly the American women. Mercer's own wife, Bettine, was American and Smithers speculated that his tone was a reflection of the couple's marital problems, or that these stories were intended as a deliberate insult to her.
