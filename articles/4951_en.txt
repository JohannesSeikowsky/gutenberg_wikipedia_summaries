Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's String Quartet No. 17 in B-flat major, K. 458, nicknamed "The Hunt", is the fourth of the quartets dedicated to Haydn. It was completed in 1784. It is in four movements:

Allegro vivace assai
Menuetto and Trio. Moderato
Adagio, in E-flat major
Allegro assai
Neither Mozart nor Artaria (the publisher) called this piece "The Hunt". "For Mozart's contemporaries, the first movement of K.458 evidently evoked the 'chasse' topic, the main components of which were a 6/8 time signature (sometimes featuring a strong upbeat) and triadic melodies based largely around  tonic and dominant chords (doubtless stemming from the physical limitations of the actual hunting horns to notes of the harmonic series)." According to Irving, Mozart's first intention was to conclude with a polonaise and sketched 65 bars (p. 17).
