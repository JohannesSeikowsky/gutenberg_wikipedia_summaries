Intermere is a 1901 utopian novel by William Alexander Taylor. The story concerns the journey of a man lost in a shipwreck and saved by the commander of a hidden ancient country, Intermere. The protagonist is instructed in Intermere's superior technology, economics, and methods of government. Taylor introduces themes on the topics of term limits for politicians, the equal distribution of wealth, and a system of motivation and reward for scientific advancement. Despite a somewhat socialist system of restriction upon trade and support for the poor, the economics are capitalist with only small business (no more than five employees) allowed to operate.
