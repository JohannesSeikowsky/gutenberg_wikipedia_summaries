The Seven Who Were Hanged (Russian: Рассказ о семи повешенных) is a 1908 horror novella by Russian author Leonid Andreyev.


== Plot ==
A minister learns of a foiled assassination plot on him by five leftist revolutionaries, and this inflicts trauma  on his peace of mind.  The novella then switches to the courts and jails to follow the fates of seven people who have received death sentences: the five failed assassins, an Estonian farm hand who murdered his employer, and a violent thief. These condemned people are awaiting their executions by hanging. In prison, each of the prisoners deals with their fate in his or her own way.
