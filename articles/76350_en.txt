== Extract ==
A race of sucklers, with gnashing jaws,
you finished the tale of the dinosaurus,
but you'll never rise above the earth
as we: you're dust and soil and dearth,
an organised pack with famished maws. -
Maybe you'll rise from your mud one day.
How much, it's up to you say."

(from 'The Last Dinosaur' in Huojuvat keulat, 1946)
