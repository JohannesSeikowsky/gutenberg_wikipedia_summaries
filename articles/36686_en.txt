The Vicar of Wrexhill is an 1837 novel by the British writer Frances Milton Trollope, originally published in three volumes. The High Church Anglican Trollope was heavily critical of the Evangelical movement. It has been described as a "scurrilous" critique of Low church Evangelical Anglicanism, often referred to in the novel as Calvinist Doctrine. It is Frances Milton Trollope's best remembered novel, with the protagonist resembling Mr Slope in her son Anthony Trollop's Barchester Towers.
