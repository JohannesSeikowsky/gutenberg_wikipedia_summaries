== Reception ==
Edmund Wilson described Studies in Classic American Literature as "one of the few first-rate books that have ever been written on the subject" despite "shots that do not hit the mark and moments that are quite hysterical." The critic Harold Bloom listed Studies in Classic American Literature in his The Western Canon (1994) as one of the books that have been important and influential in Western culture. Lawrence's work is generally credited with contributing to the restoration of Herman Melville as a seminal figure in American literature.
