The School for Husbands is a play written by Molière and originally performed in 1661 in Paris. Inspired by the Adelphoe of Terence, it was the first of his full length plays, preceding The School for Wives by a year. The plot centers on the suitors of two sisters, each of whom is a ward of each of the two men. One suitor, Sganarelle, is controlling and overbearing of his intended wife Isabella. The other suitor, Sganarelle's older brother Ariste, treats his intended wife Léonor more as an equal. Ariste eventually finds success in his pursued relationship, while Sganarelle fails miserably, so much so, in fact, that he is unwittingly used by Isabella in seeking her preferred courter, Valère.
