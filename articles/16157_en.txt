Ibong Adarna, also known as The Adarna Bird, is an early 19th century Filipino epic poem that centers around a magical bird of the same name. During the Spanish era, the longer form of the story's title was Corrido at Buhay na Pinagdaanan ng Tatlong Prinsipeng Magcacapatid na anac ni Haring Fernando at ni Reyna Valeriana sa Cahariang Berbanya' ("Corrido and Life Lived by the Three Princes, children of King Fernando and Queen Valeriana in the Kingdom of Berbania"). Some researchers suggest that the tale may have been influenced by similar European stories.
The narrative focuses on the lives of King Fernando, Queen Valeriana, and their three sons: Don Pedro, Diego, and Juan. Upon learning of their father's incurable illness, the three princes embark on a quest to find the legendary Adarna bird, whose healing powers can save their father. The prince who successfully brings back the bird will inherit the throne.
While the story is commonly attributed to the Tagalog poet José de la Cruz or "Huseng Sisiw," the actual authorship remains unproven. Contrary to popular belief, Ibong Adarna was not brought to the Philippines by Miguel López de Legazpi, as was the case with other European stories. According to Eulogio Balan Rodriguez, assistant director of the National Library in 1893, the tale is of Pre-Spanish origin and represents indigenous Philippine literature. However, it does bear some influences from 19th-century European romances, which infuse it with a medieval chivalry atmosphere. It holds a comparable status, or possibly even parallels, with the Arabian Nights' Entertainments, a book included in the reading materials of both public and private schools.
Ibong Adarna is included in the curriculum for Junior High School students and Grade 7 students in the Philippines.


== Plot ==
King Fernando and Queen Valeriana of the Kingdom of Berbanya have three sons: Don Pedro, Don Diego, and Don Juan. King Fernando falls ill after a dream in which he sees Don Juan being murdered. Desperate for a cure, he sends Don Pedro to find the Ibong Adarna, a magical bird known for its healing songs. Don Pedro embarks on a journey and eventually encounters the bird, but it sings seven songs that lull him to sleep. It then defecates on him, turning him into stone.
Next, Don Diego is sent on the same mission and suffers a similar fate. Three years later, Don Juan sets out on his quest and meets an old hermit who warns him about the bird's enchantments. The hermit provides him with a knife and dayap lemons to stay awake during the bird's songs, with instructions to create cuts on his arm with the knife and to put the calamansi on the wounds. He also gives him a golden rope to capture the bird and a bucket of water to revive his petrified brothers.
Don Juan successfully captures the Ibong Adarna, restores his brothers, and heads back to the palace. However, Don Pedro and Don Diego grow envious and beat Don Juan, leaving him unconscious on a road. They deceive the king, claiming they don't know what happened to Don Juan but that the bird awaits its true captor. Don Juan eventually recovers and forgives his brothers.
As a punishment, Don Pedro and Don Diego are supposedly killed, but Don Juan forgave them, and pleaded to his father not to, which because of that King Fernando, took it into consideration and instead tasked them to take care of the bird. Don Pedro and Don  Diego were already planning once Don Juan was asleep when it was his turn with the Adarna Bird. They agreed to release the Adarna from its cage, and upon waking up, Juan realizes and flees. Afraid his father would scold him for his irresponsibility.
Don Juan continues his journey with the Ibong Adarna followed by his brothers, finding refuge on Mt. Armenia. They come across a well, and while exploring it, Don Juan discovers two enchanted "palaces". Inside, he rescues Princess Juana and Princess Leonora from a giant and a seven-headed serpent, respectively. However, his brothers betray him by cutting the rope that he was tied to while he descends, causing him to fall to the bottom of the well.

Don Juan was heavily injured, but was cured with the help of Princess Leonora's wolf, who she has sent. and sets out to find his way back to the Kingdom.

So he gave Don Juan seven trials in which he passed all, so King Salermo tries to kill Don Juan, and out of pure anger, he cast a curse on them that when they step foot in Berbanya, Don Juan would forget Doña Maria, and he dies of his rage. So both of them, flee the pursuing king. but were separated when Don Juan leaves her to make preparations for their entry into the Berbanian Kingdom.
Back in the Berbanian Kingdom, Don Juan forgets his love for the princess from Reino de Los Cristales and falls in love with Princess Leonora again. However, when the wedding took place, Doña Maria, the princess he was truly in love— was dressed in pilgrim clothing— arrives. Doña Maria uses the jar in which the negrito people were placed to make him regain his memory, which he does. So, Don Juan reunites with Doña Maria, and was supposedly crowned King of Berbania by his father, but Don Juan gave the kingdom to Don Pedro and Princess Juana, and returns to Reino de los Cristales, where he became king, and Doña Maria became queen.
The tale ends with Don Juan and Doña Maria's coronation, symbolizing their reunion and the restoration of happiness in Reyno de Los Cristales.


== Description ==

The Ibong Adarna is often described as the most colorful bird in Philippine folklore. It is also thought to share a resemblance to other legendary birds such as the Sarimanok and the phoenix.
Being one of the most colorful birds endemic in the Philippines, local birders associate the Philippine trogon (Harpactes ardens) to the mythical bird.


== Analysis ==
According to professor Damiana Eugenio, the Ibong Adarna or The Adarna Bird epic reworks and combines themes from recognizable folktales of the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index, namely types ATU 551, "The Sons on a Quest for a Wonderful Remedy for their Father"; ATU 301, "The Three Stolen Princesses" (hero's descent into a lower world, pit or hole to rescue kidnapped princesses), and ATU 313, "The Magical Flight" (hero meets villain's daughter and falls in love with her; her father imposes tasks on the hero; hero and villain's daughter escape together at the end of the tale).
According to Dean Fansler, the romance is very popular in the archipelago, with at least five different language printings: Tagalog, Pampango, Visayan, Ilocano and Bicol. The differences between the literary versions led Fansler to believe in a folkloric origin for the tale.
