From My Farming Days (Low German: Ut mine Stromtid) is a novel by Fritz Reuter, originally published in three volumes between 1862 and 1864. Written in Low German, it portrays life in rural Mecklenburg in the 1840s in the context of the Revolutions of 1848. The novel was autobiographically-inspired as Reuter had himself worked as an apprentice farmer during the era. In 1878 it was translated into English by  M.W. MacDowell.
Although not the main character, the genial land inspector "Onkel" Zacharias Bräsig became the most well-known and his role was often emphasised in adaptations of the story.
