Gale is an itinerant who works jobs as a cotton picker, baker, cowboy, and oil rigger. He participates in a number of successive, spontaneous strikes without organized unions. He thinks of Guatemala and Argentina often.

Vorwärts, the Social Democratic Party of Germany's newspaper, published a serialized version of The Cotton-Pickers as Die Baumwollpflücker between June 21 and July 2, 1925. Büchergilde Gutenberg published a modified version as a full-length book, Der Wobbly (The Wobbly). Traven was influenced by the Wobblies (Industrial Workers of the World) in Mexico as he arrived in 1924.
