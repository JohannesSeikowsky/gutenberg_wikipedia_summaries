Fires of St. John (German: Johannisfeuer) is a 1900 play by the German writer Hermann Sudermann. It is also known as Saint John's Fire. The narrative follows a triangle drama between the daughter of a landed proprietor, her cousin who she is engaged to, and her Gypsy adoptive sister who also is in love with the cousin. The drama culminates on a Saint John's Eve which is loaded with both Christian and pre-Christian symbols. The theme of the play is gratitude and dependence, and the bonds it can create.
