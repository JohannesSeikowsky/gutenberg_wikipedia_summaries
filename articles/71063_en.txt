The below list gives an overview of the contents and stories in the Yoga Vasistha, as it appears in Swami Venkatesananda's translation. The same stories are included in the Moksopaya, on which the Yoga Vasistha was based, as well.
In the beginning of the book Vasistha states that the stories have a "definite purpose and a limited intention. They are not to be taken literally, nor is their significance to be stretched beyond the intention."


== Section One: On Dispassion ==
The Yoga Vāsiṣṭha opens with the section Vairāgya-prakaraṇa ("On Dispassion"). It begins with prince Rama returning to Ayodhya after a pilgrimage.
Rāma, though a prince of Ayodhya, is described as being profoundly disenchanted with worldly life. He finds no joy in wealth, pleasure, or power, and expresses a sense of futility about existence itself.
Concerned at his condition, King Daśaratha seeks counsel from sage Vasiṣṭha. Before Vasiṣṭha replies, however, the sage Viśvāmitra intervenes, affirming that Rāma’s state is not delusion but genuine insight born of wisdom and dispassion.
This section concludes by setting the stage for the detailed dialogue between Rāma and Vasiṣṭha, where the path toward liberation through self-knowledge will be unfolded.
