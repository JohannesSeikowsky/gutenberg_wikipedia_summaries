Baree, Son of Kazan (1917)  is an American novel by James Oliver Curwood. About a wild wolfdog pup who bonds with a girl living with her trapper father on the frontier, it is the sequel to Kazan.


== Plot ==
Baree, Son of Kazan is a novel about a wild wolfdog pup sired by Kazan (1/4 wolf, 3/4 dog) and born of blind Greywolf (pure wolf). It explores Baree's survival after he is separated as a young pup from his parents. He eventually is cared for by Nepeese and her father Pierrot, a trapper.
He bonds with Nepeese, and the novel develops from there. James Oliver Curwood took the well-used "a boy and his dog" formula, and created a great adventure story about a girl and her dog. He used this theme of a strong heroine, rather than a male hero, in many of his stories.


== Films ==
The novel was adapted as a film, Baree, Son of Kazan (1918), starring Nell Shipman as Nepeese. In 1925 David Smith directed a revised film version by the same title, starring Anita Stewart.
