The Brass Bottle is a 1900 comedy novel by the British writer Thomas Anstey Guthrie, under the pen name of F. Anstey, about a man who awakens a genie. In a much later review George Orwell praised the work, and noted how strong an influence it had on William Aubrey Darlington's 1920 work Alf's Button.
