The Hawkins Electrical Guide was a technical engineering  book written by Nehemiah Hawkins, first published in 1914, intended to explain the highly complex principles of the new technology of electricity in a way that could be understood by the common man. The book is notable for the extremely high number of detailed illustrations it contains, and the small softbound size of the volumes.
The book was published by Theodore Audel & Company, with Theodore Audel being a pseudonym for Hawkins, who was publishing his own work. The majority of the illustrative content became the basis of decades of follow-up books published under the Audels brand name. The illustrative content of these books can still be found in Audels books sold new today.
Because the Hawkins Electrical Guide was printed in the United States prior to 1923, the content of the books has passed into the public domain.


== Free media access on the Internet ==
Due to several book digitizing initiatives such as Project Gutenberg, and the Internet Archive, many of these older public domain books are becoming available on the Internet. This series of books is currently available for free, non-commercial use from Google Books and each volume can be downloaded as a PDF, though the illustration scan quality is not as good as the ones being added to Wikipedia on this page by Wikipedia contributors.
