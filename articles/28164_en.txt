The Big Bow Mystery is an 1892 mystery novel by the British writer Israel Zangwill. It was originally serialised in The Star newspaper in 1891, before being published as a novel the following year. Set in London's East End, it is one of the earliest examples of the locked-room mystery genre.

The story served as the basis for three Hollywood film versions. The Perfect Crime (1928) and The Crime Doctor (1934) were both set in the contemporary United States, and The Verdict (1946) returned the story to the late-Victorian London setting of the original novel.
