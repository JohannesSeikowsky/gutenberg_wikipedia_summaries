Dramatic Romances and Lyrics is a collection of English poems by Robert Browning, first published in 1845 in London, as the seventh volume in a series of self-published books entitled Bells and Pomegranates.


== Contents ==
Many of the original titles given by Browning to the poems in this collection, as with its predecessor Dramatic Lyrics, are different from the ones he later gave them in various editions of his collected works. Since this book was originally self-published in a very small edition, these poems really only came to prominence in the later collections, and so the later titles are given here; see the bottom of the page for a list of the originals.
