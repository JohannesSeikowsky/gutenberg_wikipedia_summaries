== Plot summary ==
Philip Jettan, a handsome and sturdy but tongue-tied youth, is rejected by his true love, Cleone because he is not foppish enough. He resolves to improve himself and travels to Paris, where he becomes a sensation. Once he returns, however, Cleone realizes she wants the old Philip in place of the "painted puppy" she has received.
