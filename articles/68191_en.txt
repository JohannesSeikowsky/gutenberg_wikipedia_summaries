The Treasure is a 1904 novel by the Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf. Its original Swedish title is Herr Arnes penningar, which means "Mr. Arne's money". It has also been published in English as Herr Arne's Hoard. Set in Bohuslän in the 16th century, it tells the story of a group of Scottish mercenaries who escape from prison; they go on to murder a family to steal a treasure chest, after which one of them falls in love with the family's sole survivor.
Lagerlöf based the novel on a true story that she heard told in the Solberga parish (Solbergatrakten), about a Mr. Arne who had been murdered at Solberga vicarage on February 15, 1586.
