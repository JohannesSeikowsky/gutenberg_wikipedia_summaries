== Plot ==
Narrated by Sir Dickon Mountjoy, a twelfth-century Norman nobleman, the novel describes his lifelong friendship with Cedric of Pelham Wood, a Saxon yeoman. Cedric the forester saves Sir Dickon's life and is made his squire. The two men become friends and have many adventures. Cedric eventually becomes the best crossbowman in England, and is knighted. Much of the novel is set in the time of King Richard the Lion Hearted, but in the final chapter Cedric plays a pivotal role in the signing of the Great Charter of King John.
