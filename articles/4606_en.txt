It Is Never Too Late to Mend (sometimes written as It's Never Too Late to Mend) is an 1856 novel by the British writer Charles Reade. It was later turned into a play. A ruthless squire becomes obsessed with a younger woman and conspires to have her lover framed and sent to jail.
The book was partly based on an earlier play of Reade's Gold!.
The book is mentioned in Jack Black's 1926 book You Can't Win as an inspiration to Black while in prison.
The Ven. George Hans Hamilton (21 Jan 1823 to 23 Sept 1905) was Chaplain of Durham Jail, and his fame concerning prison reform led to his being used as the original of the Chaplain in this book.
