The Observator was a newspaper written in the form of a dialogue by Roger L'Estrange, and published from April 13, 1681 to March 9, 1687.
L'Estrange was a defender of the Monarchy, and promoted his anti-whig agenda through The Observator.
Most issues were printed by the Brome family in London, England, at the "Gun in S. Pauls Church-yard".
