== Backgrund ==
Rob Roy wis wrate frae the Ware o 1817 an setten furth on Hogmanay o thon year.  Like the oreeginal Waverley novelle is wis pitten furth anonymously an cam in three vollums.  There wis gey muckle demaund for the novelle an a hail ship frae Leith tae Lunnon conteent naething but a hail edeetion o it.  
The novelle cam oot at a time whan mony Europeans stairtit regrettin colonialism an imperialism as wittins cam back tae thaim o ugsome atrocities taewart pretmative culturs athort the warld.  It wis a time whan there wis a muckle collogue anent the sclave tredd an aw, the Breetish occupation o Indie, an, mair relevant tae the novelle, the disasterous effect o the Hieland Clearances.  Mony scrievers gies praise tae pre-comercial culturs an their defiance agin the corruptin influence o mercat imperialism an "ceevilised" vailyies.  William Wordsworth wrate The Conventions of Cintra, praisin Spanyie resistance tae Napoleonic force; Byron wad gae on tae praise Amazonian weemen in Child Harold's Pilgrimage , turinin tapsalteery the the "polite" ordinar views o femininity that the modren "ceevilised" warld pit on them; an, finally, Scott himsel wad write aboot seemilar happenins in The Visions of Don Roderick.  Whit wis bein heized up or Scott wrate Rob Roy wis a pre-commercial cultur's preemative resistance.
