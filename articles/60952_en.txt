Von morgens bis mitternachts is an expressionist play written by the German dramatist Georg Kaiser in 1912. 
The play was banned by German censors for unclear reasons; contemporary accounts stated that the play was neither immoral nor anarchistic.
In 1917 the play was produced by the Austrian theatre director Max Reinhardt. 
It was translated for the English stage as From Morn to Midnight: A Play in Seven Scenes by Ashley Dukes, and produced by the Stage Society to negative reviews.
A modern translation by Dennis Kelly was titled From Morning to Midnight.
