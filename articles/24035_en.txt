== Summary ==
The Pirates of Zan tells the story of Bron Hoddan, a one-time engineer who sets out on a career of interstellar piracy ostensibly to further more legitimate goals.


== Reception ==
Frederik Pohl reviewed Pirates favorably, saying "It would not seem possible that after thirty years of space-pirate stories any writer could make one come alive; but Bron Hoddan is a rather unique space pirate, and Murray Leinster is a nearly unique science-fiction writer". P. Schuyler Miller praised the novel as "a rare old piece of Leinsterian adventure yarning". Amazing Stories reviewer S. E. Cotts was less enthusiastic, describing it as a "piece of lightweight science fiction, guaranteed for entertainment purposes only".
In The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, John Clute describes Pirates as "a competent but unremarkable Space Opera".
