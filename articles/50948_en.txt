== Reception ==
Anthony Boucher praised the collection, saying it "do[es] not include a dull line" and declaring it "less than firstrate only by Tenn's own high standards", noting then Tenn had "wisely" decided to exclude several of his best stories, which were already easy to find in anthologies.  P. Schuyler Miller, reported that Of All Possible Worlds was "superior entertainment" from "one of the few [sf] writers to handle humor deftly."
Aldiss and Wingrove declared Of All Possible Worlds to be Tenn's "best collection," singling out "The Liberation of Earth" as "Tenn's most satisfying and durable satire."
