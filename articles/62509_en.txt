Russian Fairy Tales (Russian: Народные русские сказки, variously translated; English titles include also Russian Folk Tales) is a collection of nearly 600 fairy and folktales, collected and published by Alexander Afanasyev between 1855 and 1863.  The collection contained fairy and folk tales from Ukraine and Belarus alongside Russian stories.  In compiling the work, Afanasyev's editing was informed by the German Grimm's Fairy Tales, Slovak tales collected by Pavol Dobšinský, Božena Němcová's work, Vuk Karadžić's Serbian tales, and other Norwegian, French, and Romanian research.
Vladimir Propp drew heavily on this collection for his analyses in his Morphology of the Folktale.
