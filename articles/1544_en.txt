The Passionate Pilgrim (1598 or 1599) is an anthology of 21 poems collected and published by William Jaggard that were attributed to "W. Shakespeare" on the title page, only five of which are considered authentically Shakespearean. These are two sonnets, later to be published in the 1609 collection of Shakespeare's Sonnets, and three poems extracted from the play Love's Labour's Lost. Five were attributed to other poets during his lifetime, and two were published in other collections anonymously. While most critics disqualify the rest as not Shakespearean on stylistic grounds, stylometric analysis by Ward Elliott and Robert Valenza put two blocks of the poems (4, 6, 7 and 9, and 10, 12, 13 and 15) within Shakespeare's stylistic boundaries. Jaggard later published an augmented edition with poems he knew to be by Thomas Heywood.


== Textual history ==
The Passionate Pilgrim was first published in an octavo volume by William Jaggard, probably in 1599 or possibly the year before, since the printer, probably Thomas Judson, had set up shop after September 1598. The date cannot be fixed with certainty, as the work was not entered in the Stationers' Register and the title page of the first edition title page is not extant. The last six poems are preceded by a second title page, headed Sonnets to Sundry Notes of Musicke, although the reason for the division is not clear.
The first edition survives only in two sheets, forming eleven leaves comprising poems 1–5 and 16–18, preserved in a fragmentary composite copy at the Folger Shakespeare Library, intermixed with sheets of the second edition that were probably added to replace defective leaves. 
In addition to the sheets incorporated into the Folger Library copy of the first edition, two complete copies of the second edition dated 1599 survive, one in the Wren Library of Trinity College, Cambridge, and the other in the Huntington Library. The title page of this edition states that the book is to be sold by stationer William Leake, who had obtained the rights to Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis in 1596 and published five octavo editions of that poem (the third edition through the eighth) between 1599 and 1602.
Jaggard issued an expanded edition of The Passionate Pilgrim in 1612, containing additional poems on the theme of Helen of Troy, announced on the title page ("Whereunto is newly added two Love Epistles, the first from Paris to Hellen, and Hellen's answere back again to Paris"). These were in fact taken from Thomas Heywood's Troia Britannica, which Jaggard had published in 1609. Heywood protested the "manifest injury done to me" in his Apology for Actors (1612), writing that Shakespeare too was "much offended" with Jaggard for making "so bold with his name", a complaint that apparently led Jaggard to revise the title page and remove Shakespeare's name. Two copies of the third edition survive, one in the Folger Library with the original title page, and the other in the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford with the cancel title page omitting Shakespeare's name.
The poems in The Passionate Pilgrim were reprinted in John Benson's 1640 edition of Shakespeare's Poems, along with the Sonnets, A Lover's Complaint, The Phoenix and the Turtle, and other pieces. Thereafter the anthology was included in collections of Shakespeare's poems, in Bernard Lintott's 1709 edition and subsequent editions.
