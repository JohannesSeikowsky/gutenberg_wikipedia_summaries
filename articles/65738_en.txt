Tales of Count Lucanor (Old Spanish: Libro de los enxiemplos del Conde Lucanor et de Patronio) is a collection of parables written in 1335 by Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena. It is one of the earliest works of prose in Castilian Spanish.
The book is divided into five parts. The first and best-known part is a series of 51 short stories (some no more than a page or two) drawn from various sources, such as Aesop and other classical writers, and Arabic folktales.
Tales of Count Lucanor was first printed in 1575 when it was published at Seville under the auspices of Argote de Molina. It was again printed at Madrid in 1642, after which it lay forgotten for nearly two centuries.


== Purpose and structure ==

The book exhibits a didactic, moralistic purpose, as would much Spanish literature that followed it. Count Lucanor engages in conversation with his advisor Patronio, putting to him a problem ("Some man has made me a proposition..." or "I fear that such and such person intends to...") and asking for advice. Patronio responds always with the greatest humility, claiming not to wish to offer advice to so illustrious a person as the Count, but offering to tell him a story of which the Count's problem reminds him. (Thus, the stories are "examples" [ejemplos] of wise action.) At the end he advises the Count to do as the protagonist of his story did.
Each chapter ends in more or less the same way, with slight variations on: "And this pleased the Count greatly and he did just so, and found it well. And Don Johán (Juan) saw that this example was very good, and had it written in this book, and composed the following verses." A rhymed couplet closes, giving the moral of the story.


== Origin of stories and influence on later literature ==
Many of the stories written in the book are the first examples written in a modern European language of various stories, which many other writers would use in the succeeding centuries. Many of the stories he included were themselves derived from other stories, coming from western and Arab sources.
Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew has the basic elements of Tale 35, "What Happened to a Young Man Who Married a Strong and Ill-tempered Woman".
Tale 32, "What Happened to the King and the Tricksters Who Made Cloth" tells the story that Hans Christian Andersen made popular as The Emperor's New Clothes.
Story 7, "What Happened to a Woman Named Truhana", a version of Aesop's The Milkmaid and Her Pail, was claimed by Max Müller to originate in the Hindu cycle Panchatantra.
Tale 2, "What happened to a good Man and his Son, leading a beast to market," is the familiar fable The miller, his son and the donkey.


== The stories ==
The book opens with a prologue which introduces the characters of the Count and Patronio. The titles in the following list are those given in Keller and Keating's 1977 translation into English. James York's 1868 translation into English gives a significantly different ordering of the stories and omits the fifty-first.

== Latter parts ==
Juan Manuel's format was evidently unsatisfying to his patron, James III of Jérica. In the latter sections of the book, he abandoned the parable device and tried to find a balance between brevity and substance acceptable to James. Parts 2 and 3 are collections of 150 succinct proverbs. In part 4, Lucano complains that the proverbs are too obscure, and Patronio responds with several direct lessons. The fifth and final part is a discourse, occasionally incorporating parables, on the importance of good works for salvation.


== In popular culture ==
The book is being read by Madrid schoolchildren in Rebecca Pawel's novel Death of a Nationalist (2003).
In 2016, Baroque Decay released a game under the name The Count Lucanor. As well as some protagonists' names, certain events from the books inspired past events in the game.
