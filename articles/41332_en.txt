Ten Thousand a-Year is a novel written by English barrister Samuel Warren.  First published in 1841, it enjoyed widespread popularity in the United States and Europe for much of the century.


== Background ==
When first published, the novel was split into three volumes for its United Kingdom release and six volumes for release in the United States. Despite Edgar Allan Poe's critical panning of the book as "shamefully ill-written" in the November 1841 issue of Graham's Magazine, it went on to become one of the most popular novels of the era in both the United States and Europe. New print runs and updated editions were published regularly to the turn of the century.
The story chronicles events in the life of its iconic protagonist Tittlebat Titmouse and offers in-depth detail of English common law of the time.
Ten Thousand a-Year was, in fact, first published in the Edinburgh Magazine in instalments in 1839. The first instalment appearing in October of that year at page 505 of No. CCLXXXVIII.
