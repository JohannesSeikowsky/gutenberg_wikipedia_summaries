== Background ==
The stories published in Nassau Literary Review while Fitzgerald was attending Princeton University, as well as those that comprise Flappers and Philosophers, may be placed among his "apprenticeship fiction."
In November 1919, Fitzgerald engaged Harold Ober as his literary agent. By early 1920, Ober had negotiated the sale of six of Fitzgerald's stories to The Saturday Evening Post, one of several "high-paying mass-circulation slick-paper magazines". Fitzgerald was paid $400 for each story. Fitzgerald's short fiction became identified with the Post in the following years, to whom he would sell sixty-five of his stories—"40 percent of his output."
Literary critic and biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli notes that "during his lifetime, Fitzgerald was far better known and more widely read as a short story writer than as a novelist."


== Reception ==

The New York Times in its September 26, 1920 edition evaluated the collection in light of Fitzgerald's recently published first novel This Side of Paradise (1920): "[H]is eight short stories range the gamut of style and mood with a brilliance, a jeu perle ["pearly tone"], so to speak, which is not to be found in the novel." The reviewer compares the works favorably to the "Russian school" and to the American author O. Henry, and closes by commending "Mr. Fitzgerald's talent and genius."


== Themes ==
Literary critic and biographer John Kuehl reports that the book reflects the social types identified in the collection's title:

Diverse characters and classes manifest themselves, yet Fitzgerald's fundamentally bourgeois world features the ubiquitous homme manqué and the femme fatale, for courtship and marriage comprise the all-important sexual element.
