== Plot summary ==
The novel concerns a man who travels 500,000 years into the future with the aid of a time machine.  There he encounters a race of intelligent furry beings, the Amphibians.  With their help he explores the planet and is eventually captured by the Dwellers, intelligent giants who direct the destiny of the continent where he had arrived.


== Critical reception ==
Boucher and McComas praised the 1949 edition, citing its "sociological criticism, spiritual stimulation and satire of high order." In 1950 L. Sprague de Camp characterized it as "one of the most remarkable science-fiction stories ever written," saying that "For atmosphere the book is absolutely unsurpassed, and for exciting action it rates high." de Camp, however, also faulted the novel's "long philosophical arguments" in dialogue between its hero and his non-human companion, particularly their "straw-man" elements.
