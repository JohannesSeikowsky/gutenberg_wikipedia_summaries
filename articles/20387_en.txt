A Thin Ghost and Others is a horror short story collection by British writer M. R. James, published in 1919. It was his third short collection. "The Story of a Disappearance and an Appearance" and "An Episode of Cathedral History" had been previously published in The Cambridge Review in 1913 and 1914 respectively; the other stories were first published in this collection. 
Several stories in this collection are part of what critic Michael Kellermeyer describes as James' "puzzle-story phase," consisting of oblique tales that require an unusual amount of interpretation. 
"An Episode of Cathedral History" has been seen as a sequel or companion piece to James' earlier story "Canon Alberic's Scrap-Book", which features a similar creature.
