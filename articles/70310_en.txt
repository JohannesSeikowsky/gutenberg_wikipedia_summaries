== Plot introduction ==
The novel is a space opera concerning the only race that is able to endure the rigors of interstellar travel.


== Reception ==
Contemporary reviews were lukewarm to mildly positive.  In F&SF, Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas  described The Starmen as "an able job of writing a completely routine and uncreative space opera."  In Galaxy Magazine, Groff Conklin called the novel "a pleasurable way to pass a couple of hours" and noted that Brackett "writes well, moves her plot along at a suitable pace, and maneuvers her characters in a lifelike manner."
