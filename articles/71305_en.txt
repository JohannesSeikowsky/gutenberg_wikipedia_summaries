"The Farmer’s Bride" was a groundbreaking piece of work that shed light on Charlotte Mew's literary expertise and unique style of writing. Mew's life, which she kept very private, was full of tumultuous sorrow, loss, and upheaval from a very young age. As the oldest daughter of seven children she watched as several of her siblings were institutionalized, suffered from mental illness, and eventually committed suicide.
