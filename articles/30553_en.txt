The Adventures of King Pausole (French: Les Aventures du roi Pausole) is a French novel with erotic themes by Pierre Louÿs, first published in serial form in 1900. The work has been called "a graceful and spicy bit of drollery".
It was the basis for the 1930 operetta Les aventures du roi Pausole with music by Arthur Honegger.
