In the Year 2889 (La Journée d’un journaliste américain en 2889 in French) is an 1889 short story published under the name of Jules Verne, but now believed to be mainly the work of his son Michel Verne, based on his father's ideas.
The first publication was in English in February 1889, in the American magazine The Forum.


== Context ==
Supposedly, the owner of the New York Herald, James Gordon Bennett, Jr, asked Jules Verne to write a short story projecting what life would look like in a thousand years. If written by Jules Verne, it would be one of his few short stories, and the only one first written in English. The story takes place on 25 September 2889.
A 1910 reprint included illustrations by George Roux.
