Alice in Blunderland: An Iridescent Dream is a novel by John Kendrick Bangs. It was first published in 1907 by Doubleday, Page & Co. of New York, with illustrations by Albert Levering. It is a political parody of the two Alice books by Lewis Carroll, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1871).
It is critical of collectivism and economic issues such as taxation, corporate greed, and corruption. Instead of entering Wonderland, Alice finds herself in "Blunderland", which is also described as "Municipal Ownership Country".


== Plot ==
Alice travels to Blunderland where nothing is supposed to be, children live in the Municipal House of the Children and the Duchess and the City are their parents. Familiar characters made famous by Alice in Wonderland make appearances in the book, including the dormouse, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat and others.
