My Lady Caprice is a 1907 romance novel by the British writer Jeffrey Farnol. A romantic drama set during the ongoing Edwardian era rather than the Regency period which he became best known for portraying, it was his debut novel. It was later republished under the alternative title Chronicles of the Imp, the title by which it had originally been serialised.
