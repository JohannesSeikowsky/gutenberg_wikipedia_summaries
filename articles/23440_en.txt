== Critical reception ==
A reviewer in The Advertiser (Adelaide) noted: "Edward Barry is a good specimen of the class of fiction of which Mr. Becke is so successful a cultivator, in which violent action and stirring incident are set in a framework of romantic scenery, and among people of a primitive type."
A writer in the Sunday Times (Sydney) was not overly impressed with the work: "The story, so far as it describes the islands, natives, and the voyage, is interesting; but the love-making and the working out of the plot are somewhat crude and disappointing."

After its original book publication in 1900 in England by publishers T. Fisher Unwin the novel was later published as follows:

L. C. Page, USA, 1924
Thomas Allen & Son Limited, Canada, 1929
