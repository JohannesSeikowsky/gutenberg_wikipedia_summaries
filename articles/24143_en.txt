The Xingcha Shenglan (Chinese: 星槎勝覽; lit. 'The Overall Survey of the Star Raft') is a Chinese historical work written by Fei Xin. Fei Xin served as a soldier in the third, fifth, and seventh Ming treasure voyages under the command of Admiral Zheng He. The book contains descriptions of foreign places that the Chinese mariners had seen. The literary term "star raft" refers to an ambassador's flagship.
According to Dreyer (2007), Fei Xin's book was strongly influenced by Ma Huan's Yingya Shenglan. Ma Huan was a translator and interpreter on Zheng He's fourth, sixth, and seventh treasure voyage.
Fei Xin's original work comprised two chapters. However, he rewrote and illustrated the initial work before presenting it to the court.
