Kormáks saga (Old Norse pronunciation: [ˈkʰorˌmɒːks ˈsaɣa], Icelandic pronunciation: [ˈkʰɔrˑmauks ˈsaːɣa]) is one of the Icelanders' sagas. The saga was probably written during the first part of the 13th century. 
Though the saga is believed to have been among the earliest sagas composed, it is well preserved. The unknown author clearly relies on oral tradition and seems unwilling to add much of his own or even to fully integrate the different accounts he knew of Kormákr. Often, he does little more than briefly set the scenes for Kormákr's stanzas, with the declarations of love often contrasting with the skald's antagonizing actions. The only complete version of the saga is found in the Icelandic manuscript 
Möðruvallabók AM 132 fol.
The saga tells of the tenth-century Icelandic poet  Kormak Ogmundsson (Kormákr Ögmundarson) and of the love of his life, Steingerd Torkelsdottir (Steingerðr Þórkelsdóttir), to whom he is betrothed. Due to a curse, he arrives too late for his wedding with Steingerðr, who  marries another. Kormak then follows King Harald Greycloak to Ireland. Later, in Scotland, he loses his life in a battle with a wizard. The saga preserves a significant number of poems attributed to Kormak, many of them dealing with his love for Steingerd.
