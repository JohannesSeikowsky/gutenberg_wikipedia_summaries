== Criticism ==
G. K. Chesterton included an essay on Helen's Babies in his collection Generally Speaking.
The book is cited in George Orwell's 1945 essay "Good Bad Books" as an example of "the kind of book that has no literary pretensions but which remains readable when more serious productions have perished." It is also discussed by Orwell in his 1946 essay "Riding Down from Bangor", in which he muses on 19th-century American children's literature and the type of society it portrayed.


== Adaptations ==
The book was adapted for the stage, and played at the Broadway Theatre in New York in 1878, and elsewhere.
Helen's Babies was also adapted into a film of the same name in 1924, directed by William A. Seiter.
