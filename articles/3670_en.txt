Peg Woffington is an 1853 novel by the British author Charles Reade. It was inspired by the popular stage play Masks and Faces which he had co-written with Tom Taylor the previous year. Reade portrayed the London success of the Irish actress Peg Woffington (1720-1760) and featured other prominent figures of the days such as David Garrick.
