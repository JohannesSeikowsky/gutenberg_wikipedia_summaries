Wigwam Stories is a children's literature book containing traditions, myths, stories, folklore, tribal customs, and sketches of Native American tribes, retold by Mary Catherine Judd. The first edition was published in 1901 in Boston by Ginn & Company.


== Overview ==
The tales were told by Native Americans and compiled by a friend of theirs. The myths which appear in Wigwam Stories are mainly those which refer to nature myths, Judd being guided in her choice by her love for nature which was fostered and encouraged by her work among children while she was a school teacher. The stories were carefully examined by several ethnologists, among them Alice Cunningham Fletcher, a lecturer at Harvard University.
The book was bound in yellow and brown in a design made up of Native American emblems. The work for the covers and for the headings of the chapters and three of the full-page drawings was done by Angel De Cora. The other illustrations were made from photographs selected with reference to sentiment and meaning by students in the several tribes from whom they are taken.
There are translations into Spanish and Norwegian.


== Reception ==
The Chicago Tribune gave the book a mixed review, but was laudatory of the artwork:

Much of the material has been drawn from the same sources that served Henry Wadsworth Longfellow when he was writing Hiawatha, but Miss Judd offers the facts and the stories apparently just as she took them first in her notebook. The traditions and myths which occupy the greater part of the book have all the charm of folklore and fairy tales, but while they are told in the simple, childlike language of the [Native American], the beautiful metaphor and fanciful imagery with which the [Native American] embellishes his language is entirely lacking... The first part of the book, 'Sketches of Various Tribes of North American Indians', reads more or less like an extract from an encyclopedia, but the second and third parts, 'Traditions and Myths' and 'Stories Recently Told of Hiawatha and Other Heroes', cannot fail, because of their subject matter, to be entertaining to the average reader... Several of the illustrations in the book, as well as the cover design, are the work of Miss Angel de Cora, a gifted young Indian artist, thus giving to the pictorial features of the volume an unusually true reproduction of the atmosphere of Indian life.
