The Castle of Andalusia is a 1782 comic opera by Samuel Arnold and a libretto by John O'Keeffe. It was a heavily rewritten version of the 1781 work The Banditti, which had been a failure.
After its first performance on 2 November 1782, the original run saw the work performed thirty-nine times, and it was revived on several occasions until 1817. It became a popular play for amateur dramatics and was performed by the Kilkenny players, including many of the elite, with the writer Thomas Moore appearing several times in the role of Spado.
