== Contemporary reception ==
The New York Review of Books reviewed the novel in 1840 and was unimpressed, saying the novel was not contributing to "any great increase of fame or fortune to Mr Cooper". The review continued to describe the novel as not including much "romance", instead successfully focusing on the historical elements. In 1978, critic Kennedy Williams, Jr. agreed with the assessment, noting that the novel uses history well and accurately, but is Cooper's best example of the combination of history and fiction when "fail[ing] miserably" in Cooper's novels.
