The Everlasting Mercy is a poem by John Masefield, the UK's second longest serving poet laureate after Alfred, Lord Tennyson.
It was published in 1911 and is styled as the confession of a man who has turned from sin to Christianity. As a work that first made Masefield famous, it shocked early 20th-century British sensibilities with its direct, honest, and therefore often harsh language, as the life of protagonist violent, drunken womanizer Saul Kane is laid out in detail.

In the third episode of the American TV series Peter Gunn, The Vicious Dog, the last line is the antagonist's, asked why he'd committed the crimes, responding with a quote from The Everlasting Mercy: 

O Lord, the sin 
Done for things there's money in.
The poem is also mentioned in William Gaddis’s “The Recognitions”. One of the characters is reading a book of poetry by John Mansfield while on the deck of a boat as it passes the Rock of Gibraltar.
