== Critical reception ==
In The Richmond River Herald and Northern Districts Advertiser a writer noted: "This collection of stories is racy of the soil, and full of the inimitable 'Banjo's peculiar and effective humor."
A reviewer in the Goulburn Evening Penny Post wrote: "In this collection Paterson has given Australia something superior to anything previously published by him. There isn't a dull yarn from cover to cover, and discernment of character and correctness of detail are shown on practically every page. Paterson instinctively sees the underlying humour of common happenings, and brings it to the surface with the skill of one who understands and can discriminate."
The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature states that the stories "reveal Paterson's capacity for capturing an authentic Australian tone."
