In the Days When the World Was Wide and Other Verses (1896) is the first collection of poems by Australian poet and author Henry Lawson. It was released in hardback by Angus and Robertson in 1896, and features the poet's widely anthologised poems "The Free Selector's Daughter", "Andy's Gone with Cattle", "Middleton's Rouseabout" and the best of Lawson's contributions to The Bulletin Debate, a famous dispute in The Bulletin magazine from 1892-93 between Lawson and Banjo Paterson.
The collection contains a dedication to J. F. Archibald and on the title page a sketch by Frank Mahony of Lawson 'humping his bluey'.

A reviewer in The Evening News (Sydney), on the original publication, noted that "What is best in Mr. Lawson's verse is its genuine local color, to employ a much misused but, in this case, strictly appropriate, phrase. Where he is strongest, most picturesque, and most poetical, he is unmistakably Australian — a man really influenced by his surroundings, and expressing himself in that natural way which is essential to the production of a true poetic note of any kind.
In the Australian Town and Country Journal the reviewer concluded that "What Kipling has done for "Tommy Atkins" in the great Indian colony, Lawson has done for the silent wanderer on the dreary Australia plains, giving voice to many a dumb heart, and translating its unbroken emotions into verse in such songs as "A Prouder Man than You," "The Shame of Going Back," "Since Then" and "Sez You.""
