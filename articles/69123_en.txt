Saltego trans Jarmiloj (English: Leap across the Millennia) is the second novel originally written in Esperanto by Jean Forge.  It appeared in 1924 (192 pages).  It is a fantasy, whose characters are transported out of our time into a past epoch.  Written in a simple lively style, despite its humor and other attractions, it does not reach the level of Forge's first novel, Abismoj.
