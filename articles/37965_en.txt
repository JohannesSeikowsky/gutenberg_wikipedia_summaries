Caesar's Wife is a 1919 play by the British writer Somerset Maugham. Its West End run at the Royalty Theatre in London lasted for 241 performances from 27 March to 25 October 1919. Amongst the original cast were C. Aubrey Smith, Fay Compton, George Relph, and Helen Haye.
The title presumably refers to Pompeia, one of the wives of Julius Caesar.
