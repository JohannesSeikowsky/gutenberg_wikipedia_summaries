Operation: Outer Space is a science fiction novel by American writer Murray Leinster. It was first published in 1954 by Fantasy Press.


== Premise ==
The novel concerns the first interstellar flight, financed by making it into a television show.


== Reception ==
Galaxy reviewer Groff Conklin praised the novel as "a fast-paced, sardonic job that is primarily a satire on the future of mass communications." Anthony Boucher similarly praised the novel's satirical elements, although he found that "a slight lack of genuine bite and emotion" kept the novel "from being a front-ranker." P. Schuyler Miller reported that "It's no classic, but it's good reading."
