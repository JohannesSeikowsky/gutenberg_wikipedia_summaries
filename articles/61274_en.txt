The Quest for Fire (French: La Guerre du feu, literally The War of Fire) is a 1911 Belgian fantasy novel by J.-H. Rosny, the pseudonym of two brothers; the author was actually the elder of the two, Joseph Henri Honoré Boex (1856–1940). It was first published in English in an abridged edition in 1967.


== Setting ==
The Quest for Fire takes place in 100,000 BC in Europe. The fauna of this period is omnipresent, including: mammoths, cave lions, aurochs, cave bears, saber-toothed cats, giant elks and saiga antelopes. Several humanoid species live alongside animals: 

The Ulams - Neanderthal-like hunters-gatherers who worship the fire and are able to ally themselves with beasts.
The Wahs - People without shoulders from marshes.
The Blue-Haired Men - Huge four-handed simians with a bluish fur.
The Men-Eaters - Bestial cannibals.
The Red Dwarfs - Extremely warmongering and xenophobic pygmies.

== Scientific response ==
Italian paleontologist Giorgio Manzi praised both the novel and its movie adaptation for their prescient vision: for him, they can alternatively be seen as a journey through human evolution, where the protagonists meet different species of Homo that succeeded one another through time; or, as a journey through space, with different human species that coexisted (and interbred) in different parts of the world. Finally, they could also be seen as a representation of diversity within Neanderthals, that are now known to have had "modern" traits, like the production of jewelry, but to also have engaged in cannibalism.


== Adaptation ==
It was adapted into the critically acclaimed 1981 film Quest for Fire starring Everett McGill, Ron Perlman, Nicholas Kadi, and Rae Dawn Chong. The film is not a faithful adaptation of the book.
