Christie Johnstone is an 1853 romantic drama novel by the British writer Charles Reade. It follows the adventures of the young and wealthy aristocrat Viscount Ipsden in the course of his efforts to relieve the deserving poor of a Scottish fishing village. It is set in Newhaven near Edinburgh and may have been based on the real life experiences of Reade. It followed up his first major literary success Peg Woffington, released earlier the same year.
