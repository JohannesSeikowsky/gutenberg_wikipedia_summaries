The Adventures of Three Russians and Three Englishmen in South Africa (French: Aventures de trois Russes et de trois Anglais dans l'Afrique australe) is a novel by Jules Verne published in 1872.


== Plot introduction ==
Three Russian and three English scientists depart to South Africa to measure the 24th meridian east. As their mission is proceeding, the Crimean War breaks out, and the members of the expedition find themselves citizens of enemy countries.
This novel can be found under alternate titles such as Adventures in the Land of the Behemoth, Measuring a Meridian, and Meridiana or Adventures in South Africa. Interestingly, the travelers, on their homeward journey, reach Victoria Falls on 25 May 1855, thus anticipating the discovery by David Livingstone by nearly six months.
