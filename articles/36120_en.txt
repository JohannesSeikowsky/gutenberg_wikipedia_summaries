Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary (1758) is a two-volume compilation of essays by David Hume. Part I includes the essays from Essays, Moral and Political, plus two essays from Four Dissertations. The content of this part largely covers political and aesthetic issues. Part II includes the essays from Political Discourses, most of which develop economic themes. The total two-part collection appeared within a larger collection of Hume's writings titled Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects. This was a collaborative publication with the important Scottish printer and publisher Alexander Kincaid, with whom the bookseller Andrew Millar had a lucrative but sometimes difficult relationship.
