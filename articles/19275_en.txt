God Passes By, written by Shoghi Effendi, head of the Baháʼí Faith in the first half of the 20th century, is a book which provides a historical summary of the first century of the Baháʼí Faith, from 1844 to 1944.  While historical episodes are recounted in some detail, "God Passes By" is particularly notable for the significance Shoghi Effendi assigns to events in the history of the Baháʼí Faith, and the interpretation he gives to various episodes.
