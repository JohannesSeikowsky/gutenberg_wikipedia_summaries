Mountain Interval is a 1916 poetry collection by American poet Robert Frost. Published by Henry Holt, it is Frost's third poetic volume.


== Background ==
The book was republished in 1920, and after making several alterations in the sequencing of the collection, Frost released a new edition in 1924.
