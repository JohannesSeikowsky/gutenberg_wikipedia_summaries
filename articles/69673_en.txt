Old Heidelberg (German: Alt Heidelberg) is a German romantic play by Wilhelm Meyer-Förster first performed in 1901. While studying at the Heidelberg University, Prince Karl from Saxony falls in love with Käthie, an innkeeper's daughter, but has to give her up when his father dies, and he is called to return to his homeland and rule as King.
The play was based on Meyer-Förster's own 1898 novel Karl Heinrich. The play's title alludes to a poem by Joseph Victor von Scheffel.  The work was a major international success and became one of the most performed plays in Germany during the first half of the 20th century.
