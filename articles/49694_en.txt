The Duke in the Suburbs is a 1909 novel by the British writer Edgar Wallace.
Unusually for Wallace, best known for his heavy thrillers, it is a comedy about a Duke who goes to live in a street in the suburbs and the impact he has on the pretentious middle-class residents. It has been described as Wodehousian in style.
