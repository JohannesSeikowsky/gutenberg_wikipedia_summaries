Juan José is an 1895 melodramatic play by the Spanish writer Joaquín Dicenta. It was first staged at the Teatro de la Comedia in Madrid on 25 October 1895. The film adaptation became noted for its subversive social criticism and was often banned. A tradition developed of staging the play on May Day. Between 1895 and 1939 it was estimated to be the second most performed play in Spain.
