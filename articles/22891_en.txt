The nursery rhyme is about a foolish or naive boy named Simon who doesn’t understand basic common sense situations.

It’s often interpreted as a light-hearted way to teach children about manners, common sense, and the importance of thinking before acting.


== Text ==

The rhyme is as follows;

Simple Simon met a pieman,
Going to the fair;
Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
Let me taste your ware.
Said the pieman to Simple Simon,
Show me first your penny;
Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
Sir I haven't any.
Simple Simon went a-fishing,
For to catch a whale;
All the water he had got,
Was in his mother's pail.
Simple Simon went to look
If plums grew on a thistle;
He pricked his fingers very much,
Which made poor Simon whistle.
He went for water in a sieve
But soon it all fell through
And now poor Simple Simon
Bids you all adieu!


== Origin ==
The verses used today are the first of a longer chapbook history first published in 1764. The character of Simple Simon may have been in circulation much longer, possibly through an Elizabethan chapbook and in a ballad, Simple Simon's Misfortunes and his Wife Margery's Cruelty, from about 1685.  A possible inspiration is Simon Edy, a beggar of the St Giles area in the 18th century.
