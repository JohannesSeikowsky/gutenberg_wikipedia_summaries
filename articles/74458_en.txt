Victoria (Norwegian: Victoria. En kjærlighedshistorie, 1898) is a novel by Knut Hamsun.


== Overview ==
A miller's son, Johannes, falls in love with the daughter of a wealthy landowner, Victoria.  The novel follows them through adolescence, as Johannes struggles with the social hierarchy and becomes a successful author, and Victoria is forced into marrying Otto, a lieutenant, to save the troubled family economy.
A lyrical excursion into unconsummated love, love that is described memorably as Blood and Blossoms.
