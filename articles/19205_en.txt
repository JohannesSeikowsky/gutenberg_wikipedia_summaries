The Vikings at Helgeland (Norwegian: Hærmændene paa Helgeland) is Henrik Ibsen's seventh play. It was written during 1857 and first performed at Christiania Norske Theater in Oslo on 24 November 1858. The story takes place during the time of Erik Blood-axe (c. 930 – c. 934) in the north of Norway in historic Helgeland, a time in which Norwegian society was adjusting from the tradition of Old Norse Sagas to the new era of Christianity. It concerns the arrival of Ørnulf, who with his seven sons is seeking his daughter, Dagny, and foster-daughter, Hjørdis, who were abducted and married by Sigurd and Gunnar, respectively. Tragedy compounded by conceptions of honour and duty lead to the deaths of all of Ørnulf's sons, Sigurd (who is killed by Hjørdis), and Hjørdis (by suicide). The plot is reminiscent of the Germanic myth of Sigmund and Brynhilde.
