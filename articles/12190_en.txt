== Summary ==
In the early spring of 1884, the three-masted schooner Castor, en route from San Francisco to Valparaiso, encountered a violent tornado off the coast of Peru. The storm, which struck with terrifying swiftness, was brief but devastating. It left the Castor in ruins, her masts snapped and lost overboard, her rudder shattered by the falling debris. The ship was left adrift, rolling in the sea's trough as the floating remnants of her masts and spars battered against her sides.
