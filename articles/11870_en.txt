The Country of the Blind and Other Stories is a collection of thirty-three fantasy and science fiction short stories written by the English author H. G. Wells between 1894 and 1909. It was first published by Thomas Nelson and Sons in 1911. All the stories had first been published in various weekly and monthly periodicals. Twenty-seven of the stories had also been previously published in five earlier story collections by Wells.
The title of this collection refers to one of Wells's best-known short stories, "The Country of the Blind", which is included in this book.


== Introduction ==
In his introduction to this book, Wells wrote that this collection covers "all the short stories by me that I care for any one to read again." He went on to say that except for the two sets of linked stories "A Story of the Stone Age" and "A Story of the Days To Come" in his earlier collection, Tales of Space and Time (1899), "no short story of mine of the slightest merit is excluded from this volume."
