The Great Prince Shan is a 1922 thriller novel by E. Phillips Oppenheim.


== Adaptation ==
In 1922, the columnist 'Lucette' described, and critiqued, the book thus:

With scene laid in the year 1934, in an England whose navy and army have almost disappeared and where the Briton puts his faith in peaceful, commercial enterprises and the League of Nations, Phillips Oppenheim has built his latest story... It is, of course, well told, chatty, witty, and the tale of how catastrophe is averted is cleverly unfolded. Not, perhaps, quite as good as others from the same pen, but not a volume to be passed over, for all that.
In 1924 it was adapted by Stoll Pictures into a film The Great Prince Shan directed by A. E. Coleby and starring Sessue Hayakawa.
