The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan is a satirical Oriental novel in English. It was written in 1824 by James Justinian Morier, a former British envoy who lived in Qajar Iran in 1808–1809 and 1810–1814, amidst the diplomatic difficulties that the country had with European nations. It was followed by a sequel The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan in England in 1828.
With a distinctly negative and satirical undertone, Morier based this novel on his own experiences and personal understanding of Iran.
