And Five Were Foolish is a 1924 collection of short stories by the English author Dornford Yates (Cecil William Mercer), first published in The Windsor Magazine. The title is a reference to the Parable of the Ten Virgins.


== Plot ==
The book consists of ten short stories, several inspired by incidents and places known to Mercer and all named after a significant female character.


== Background ==
The stories were written for The Windsor Magazine, which boasted its readers had been "clamouring for more".


== Chapters ==


== Critical reception ==
The collected volume was a significant success, reprinted seven times before World War II. The original dust jacket carried a Daily Telegraph quote:

The reader may decide for himself which five of Mr. Dornford Yates's virgins were foolish. Opinions will probably vary, and perhaps not one of the host of readers which the book deserves will compile a list tallying exactly with that which the author has drawn up in his own mind. But there will at least be unanimity on the point that here are ten extraordinary powerful and intriguing stories.
