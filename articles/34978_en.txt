Burning Sands is a 1921 dramatic adventure novel by the British writer Arthur Weigall. It was originally published in Britain under the alternative title The Dweller in the Desert. Set in the Middle East, the novel was a riposte to the 1919 novel The Sheik by E. M. Hull.

In 1922 it was adapted into an American silent film Burning Sands directed by George Melford and starring Wanda Hawley, Milton Sills and Jacqueline Logan. It was produced by Paramount Pictures who were hoping to capitalise on the enormous success of the previous year's film version of The Sheik.
