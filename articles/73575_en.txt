The Hounds of Tindalos is a collection of fantasy, horror and science fiction short stories by American writer Frank Belknap Long. It was released in 1946 and was the author's third book.  It was published by Arkham House in an edition of 2,602 copies with cover art by Hannes Bok. A British hardcover was issued by Museum Press in 1950. Belmont Books reprinted The Hounds of Tindalos in two paperback volumes, The Hounds of Tindalos (1963) and The Dark Beasts (1964), omitting three stories; Panther Books issued a complete two-volume British paperback edition as The Hounds of Tindalos (1975) and The Black Druid (1975).
The 1975 Doubleday collection The Early Long may be considered as crucially supplemental to the Arkham House volume, since while it comprises only seventeen of the twenty-one stories in the  Arkham House book, it adds "an excellent introduction and head notes" written by Long. (The 1978 paperback edition of The Early Long was retitled The Hounds of Tindalos.)

== Reception ==
E. F. Bleiler wrote that "While the earlier material is now interesting mostly for nostalgic reasons, the stories written in Long's maturer period, the late 1930s on, are noteworthy for the concrete, tangible, yet highly moving horrors that permeate them.
