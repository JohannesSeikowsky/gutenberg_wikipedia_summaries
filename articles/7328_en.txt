The Shuo Yuan (Chinese: 說苑; Jyutping: Syut3 Jyun2; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Soat-oán), variously translated as Garden of Stories, Garden of Persuasions, Garden of Talks, Garden of Eloquence, etc., is a collection of stories and anecdotes from the pre-Qin period (先秦) to the Western Han dynasty. The stories were compiled and annotated by the imperial librarian Liu Xiang (died 6 BCE). In many cases, multiple versions of the same story are included, making the book a valuable source for the study of early texts.
