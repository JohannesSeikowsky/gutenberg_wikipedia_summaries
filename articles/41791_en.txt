== Film adaptation ==
In 1950, it was turned into an American film noir House by the River directed by Fritz Lang and starring Louis Hayward, Lee Bowman and Jane Wyatt. This shifted the action from the original setting of Hammersmith to the United States and moved the period back to the Victorian era rather than the post-First World War of the novel.
