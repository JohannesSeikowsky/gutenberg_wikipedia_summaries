Women Painters of the World, from the time of Caterina Vigri, 1413–1463, to Rosa Bonheur and the present day, assembled and edited by Walter Shaw Sparrow, is a book that lists an overview of prominent women painters up to 1905, the year of publication.
The purpose of the book was to prove wrong the statement that "the achievements of women painters have been second-rate." The book includes well over 300 images of paintings by over 200 painters, most of whom were born in the 19th century and won medals and awards at various international exhibitions. The book is a useful reference work for anyone studying women's art of the late 19th century.
