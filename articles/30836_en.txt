Seven Keys to Baldpate is a 1913 novel by Earl Derr Biggers. A bestseller, it was adapted by George M. Cohan into a play, which in turn was adapted several times for film, radio and TV.
The novel concerns a writer named Billy Magee, who tries to escape the city and stay at the quiet Baldpate Inn to get some inspiration for his next novel; however, he discovers that six other people have keys to the inn and he gets embroiled in their lives with incidences of bribery, punch-ups and gunfire.
The plot of the novel differs from the play in many respects.
The setting was based on the real Baldpate Mountain. An American hotel inspired by that name, The Baldpate Inn, opened in 1918.
