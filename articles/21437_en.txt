North of Boston is a poetry collection by Robert Frost, first published in 1914 by David Nutt, in London. Most of the poems resemble short dramas or dialogues. It is also called a book of people because most of the poems deal with New England themes and Yankee farmers. Ezra Pound wrote a review of this collection in 1914. Despite it being called "North of Boston", none of the poems have that name.


== Background ==
Following its success, Henry Holt and Company republished Frost's first book in the United States, A Boy's Will, in 1915. The New York Times said in a review, "In republishing his first book after his second, Mr. Robert Frost has undertaken the difficult task of competing with himself."
