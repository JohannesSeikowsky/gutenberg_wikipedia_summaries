The book was received positively among many literary critics and civil rights activists. Writing for the magazine The Crisis, W.E.B. Du Bois hailed the novel as "a stirring story and a strong bit of propaganda against the white Klansman and the black pussyfoot." Writing for The Nation, Konrad Bercovici stated that the novel was "the voice of the new Negro". Sinclair Lewis called it one of the two most important books of the autumn. Historian Kevin Boyle, in his 2004 book Arc of Justice stated: "The novel's publication was one of the signal events of the Harlem Renaissance's breakthrough year. Somerset Maugham stated it was "a terrible book, but a very powerful one, and it gives one a tragic feeling of truth."
