== Publication ==
John Camden Hotten prepared the book for the press.
Dragana Đorđević believes the book to be backdated and argues that it was in fact printed in 1873 because "custom of back-dating a new text was as common in this business as the practice of up-dating an old one." 100 copies were advertised but 250 were actually printed.


== Reception ==
Steven Marcus regards it "with a certain amount of sympathy and respect."
