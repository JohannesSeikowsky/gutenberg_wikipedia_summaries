Seldwyla Folks, also published as The People of Seldwyla (German: Die Leute von Seldwyla), is a sequence of novellas by the Swiss writer Gottfried Keller. The ten stories are set around the fictional small town of Seldwyla in Switzerland. Each story is about an obsession or fixation that leads to excess, bigotry or self-indulgence.
The first five stories were written from 1853 to 1855 and published together in 1856. The second half was written from 1860 to 1875, while the finished sequence was published together from 1873 to 1875.
