== Plot ==
Cecilia Holt ends her engagement to Sir Francis Geraldine because of his indifference to her; she goes abroad and meets Mr. George Western, who has been jilted by a beautiful girl. They marry, but she does not tell him she has been previously engaged, though he has told her his story. When Western is informed of the previous engagement by Sir Francis, he leaves his wife and goes abroad; Cecilia returns to Exeter to live with her mother. Her sister-in-law in the end effects a reconciliation. There is a comic sub-plot, often found in Trollope's work, involving one of Cecilia's friends who attempts to marry Sir Francis. The novel is principally about duty and truth in marriage, and the relationship of a couple to society.


== Reaction ==
The novel received mediocre reviews. Trollope died in the year following its publication.
