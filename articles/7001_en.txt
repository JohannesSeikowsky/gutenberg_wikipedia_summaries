Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas ('Events of the Philippine Islands') is a book written and published by Antonio de Morga considered one of the most important works on the early history of the Spanish colonization of the Philippines. It was published in 1609 after he was reassigned to Mexico in two volumes by Casa de Geronymo Balli, in Mexico City. The first English translation was published in London in 1868 and another English translation by Blair and Robertson was published in Cleveland in 1907.
The work greatly impressed but also garnered heavy criticism from Philippine national hero José Rizal who found it rife with erroneous claims and a eurocentric bias. Rizal decided to annotate it and publish a new edition and began working on it in London and completing it in Paris in 1890.
