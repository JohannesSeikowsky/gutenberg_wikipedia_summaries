== Synopsis ==
Doctor Ringwood, acting as a locum in a small town while the GP is away, is called out one very foggy evening to attend to an urgent case. By accident goes to the house next door and finds a dying man who has clearly been shot. He goes next door to telephone for the police, and examines the patient he had been called out to tend to who is suffering from scarlet fever. He returns to the other house to stand guard until Sir Clinton Driffield and his colleague Inspector Flamborough arrive. During their time at the crime scene, a second murder takes place next door. Two further deaths occur before the case is solved, as Driffield works through the nine possible solutions of the killings.
