Kaw-djer, whose motto is "Neither God nor master", helps himself survive and also provides assistance to the indigenous peoples of Magellania.  However, when a group of settlers is shipwrecked on a nearby island (Hoste Island), Kaw-djer assists them establish their colony, though he refuses to rule over them or control them in any way.
