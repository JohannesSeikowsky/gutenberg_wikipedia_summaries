== Description ==
The setting of the novel was the way of life in the high-levels of Philippine society. The main characters of the story are Elsa (the mestiza), Tirso Silveira (a poet and lawyer), and Teang (the female college student). The main focus of the novel is Elsa, who being a mestiza of Spanish descent, was the representation of arrogance, selfishness, and contemptuousness of the Filipino lower-class. Elsa fell in love with Tirso Silveira but Silveira fell in love with Teang, the representation of coyness or diffidence, kindness, and warmth. Elsa and Teang are opposites of one another. The love triangle, despite Elsa's plans to win Silveira’s heart, resulted in the union of Silveira and Teang. Elsa, as a consequence of her failure, succumbs to insanity.
