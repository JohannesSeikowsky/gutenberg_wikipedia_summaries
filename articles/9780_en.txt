== Reception ==
Reviewing the novel, Frederic Taber Cooper praised Margaret. Cooper stated: "Mr. Haggard has the craft of a born stage manager, and thanks to his gorgeous scenery, his thronging troops of soldiers, sailors, courtiers, black-robed inquisitors, and languishing Spanish maids, he brings his story to a triumphant and happy solution, and sends us away with the feeling that we have witnessed a big, spectacular show that was eminently worth while."
