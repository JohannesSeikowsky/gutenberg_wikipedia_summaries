== Plot summary ==
A 5-year-old girl named Dot is lost in the bush after chasing a hare into the wood and losing sight of her home. She is approached by a grey kangaroo who gives her some berries to eat. Upon eating the berries, Dot is able to understand the language of all animals, and she tells the kangaroo her plight. The kangaroo, who has lost her own joey, decides to help little Dot despite her own fear of humans. They consult the platypus (who insists on being called Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus) and he tells them that Willy Wagtail will be able to help her. After much adventure, including being hunted by Aborigines and Dot being on trial in an animal court, Dot and her kangaroo finally find her home, and the kangaroo finds her joey there.
