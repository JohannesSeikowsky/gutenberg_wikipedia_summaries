== Summary ==
Charles Thompson, an African-American born in Atala County, Mississippi, writes about his life as a slave. Thompson relates events which happened when he was about nine years old, after his owner, a man named Kirkwood, died. Kirkwood had owned many plantations, including the one where Thompson was born near a town called Rockford. Slaves on the plantations were being separated to prevent them from revolting or attempting to escape. At age thirty-seven his mother died. Ben, his uncle, hid from his owners so he could stay with his wife. He evaded the bloodhounds and even the owners walking through the cabin to try to find him when he was just hiding in a hind passage close to his wife. He finally surrendered when his owner agreed that he could be with his wife on another plantation.
Thompson goes on to describe his life as an adult slave, including being hired out to other plantations and teaching Christianity to his fellow slaves.
