The Convent School, or Early Experiences of A Young Flagellant is a 19th-century work of sado-masochistic pornography, written under the pseudonym Rosa Coote and published by William Dugdale in London in 1876.  Henry Spencer Ashbee catalogues it with the comment that "the numerous flagellations, supplemented by filthy tortures, are insuperably tedious and revolting".  The principal character and ostensible author Rosa Coote also appears in a series of related stories in The Pearl magazine.
