The Hollow Tree Snowed-In Book is a children's book of short stories written by Albert Bigelow Paine and illustrated by J. M. Condé. It was published by Harper & Brothers in 1910. The book contains the continued tales of the 'Coon, the 'Possum, and the Old Black Crow, who live in the Hollow Tree in the Deep Woods.
These books contain pen-and-ink illustrations of the stories.
The general setting of this book is 'the story teller' who sits in a rocking chair in front of the old fireplace, with the 'Little Lady' sitting on his lap as he smokes a pipe and tells the old stories of the Hollow Tree Folk.
All the stories in this book are stories told by the various characters when there is a big snow storm and they get snowed in. To pass the time they tell stories.
