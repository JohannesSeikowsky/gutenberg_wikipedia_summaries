== Plot ==
Sally Nicholas is a young, pretty, and popular American woman who lives in a boarding house in New York and works as a taxi dancer. Upon reaching her twenty-first birthday, she inherits a considerable fortune. Sally tries to adjust to her new life, but financial and romantic problems beset her until a happy ending ensues.


== Reception ==
Wodehouse biographer Richard Usborne called The Adventures of Sally "a jerky, choppy book... Several short-story themes are tied up untidily together and there is a scrambling of loose ends to finish up."
