The Prodigal Judge is a novel written by American novelist Vaughan Kester and published in 1911.
Kester wrote the novel while living at Gunston Hall in Virginia. A best-seller, it was the second-best selling fiction book in the United States in 1911.  Kester died in July 1911, but not before enjoying the knowledge his book had reached the top of the bestseller lists.
To promote the book, publisher Bobbs-Merrill Company held a "book review contest", with prizes of $250, $150, and $100 for the first through third best reviews published in the first month of the book's release, judged by a panel consisting of Yale University professor William Lyon Phelps, magazine editor John Sanborn Phillips, and writer William Allen White.  Third place went to H. L. Mencken.
