Many Marriages is a novel by Sherwood Anderson published in 1923. In this novel, Anderson continued his use of new psychological insights to explore his characters.
Because Anderson explored the new sexual freedom in the novel, it was attacked in an American crusade against "dirty books", which also objected to D.H. Lawrence's Women in Love. Sales of Anderson's novel declined markedly after this unwelcome publicity.
F. Scott Fitzgerald considered Many Marriages to be Anderson's finest novel.
