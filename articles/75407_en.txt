== Synopsis ==
During a fancy dress party at the country estate of Ravensthorpe, an attempt is made to rob the museum room of the house containing the house's valuable collection. The main target seems to be some medallions about to be sold to an American millionaire. Sir Clinton, an old friend of the family and a guest at the party, takes over the investigation. When two deaths follow in the wake of the failed robbery, he works to establish what connection they may have with the valuable collection.
