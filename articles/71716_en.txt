== Plot introduction ==
Two explorers travel miles beneath Mount Rainier and discover a cavernous realm, filled with glowing mist, called Drome, which is home to a lost civilization and fantastic animals including bat-apes, snake-cats and tree-octopuses.


== Reception ==
P. Schuyler Miller described the story as quaint by 1953 standards, but praised "its classical quotations, bolstering allusions to dubious science, and real warmth and humor." Everett F. Bleiler faulted the novel for doing little to explain its mysteries and for being "greatly padded with 'philosophy of life', quotations from various authorities scientific and philosophical, lists of great men, and exclamations and comments in Siwash."
