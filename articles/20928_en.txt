Three Months in the Southern States is a book written by British Colonel  Arthur Fremantle, of the Coldstream Guards, upon his return to England from his three-months traveling through the Confederacy during the American Civil War in 1863, from April 2 until July 16.
Most specifically mentioned in the book are Fremantle's travels through Texas and the Deep South, and finally – when he arrived at Robert E. Lee's  Army of Northern Virginia on June 27, and witnessed the Battle of Gettysburg at  first-hand – as part of a cadre of foreign observers attached to the headquarters of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, in charge of that amy's 1st Corps, and Lee's longest-serving subordinate commander.
When published, the book became a best seller in Great Britain and in America, both North and South, but was then mostly forgotten until its reissue on the eve of the centennial of the Civil War.
