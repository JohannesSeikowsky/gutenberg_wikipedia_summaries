== Storyline ==
The book is based on a near-future story of Lester and Perry, two hardware hackers, and Suzanne, a journalist. Lester and Perry rebuild devices or 3D print things to sell. Kettlewell, the CEO of Kodak and Duracell, becomes aware of this and sends the journalist Suzanne on site to report on it in her blog. Lester and Perry's manufactured products are then manufactured and sold in large quantities. Afterwards, Lester and Perry open an interactive museum and are sued by Disney. Since they file a counterclaim, they settle out of court and Lester transfers to Disney to make new products for them.
The story contains numerous side-themes. For instance, extremely fat people like Lester can take a gene-therapy, if they can afford it, and become slim no matter how much they eat. The downside: they must now consume 10'000 kcal/d or so just to survive. They call themselves "fatkins" and get special clubs and restaurants.
