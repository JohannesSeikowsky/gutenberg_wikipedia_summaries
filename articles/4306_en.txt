As an old friend of Gissing, H. G. Wells was asked to write an introduction to Veranilda. Displeased with the piece Wells wrote, Gissing's relatives and literary executors then asked Frederic Harrison to write a substitute. Well's rejected preface was later published under the title "George Gissing: An Impression".
